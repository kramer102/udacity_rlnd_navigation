    "The primary difference between the implementation of DQN in [Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/dqn/DQNNaturePaper.pdf) and this Navigation project is direct knowledge of the enviornment in Navigation. The original DQN used only the screen images to learn Atari games. They pre-process the screen shots using $\\phi$ to generalize across many games. Our enviornment is only 37 inputs and we are able to use a simple multi-layer perceptron Q Network function approximator instead of the CNN archetecture listed in the paper <br>\n",
